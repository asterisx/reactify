## Why this library

- **Component Composition.** Most of the components are built to accept other components as children which can be used to make some new powerful and interesting components.
The idea is to make these components behave like *containers* with some functionalities as their name suggest and let them accept any content inside.
Due to the vastness of permutation and combinations, many new UI elements can be made by stacking together the lib ones.

- **Inbuilt support for theming**
[Check out the theming section.](https://asterisx.github.io/reactify-ui/advanced/theming)

- **Easy styling** with support for many kinds of styling, i.e the components do not have any preference when it comes to styling and support multiple ways of styling.
You can pass className, the styles prop and most components have BEM class names if you wish to target that way.
